*DESCRIPTION*: Our mobile app redesign project focused on enhancing the Spotify user experience by addressing visual clutter, limited interaction feedback, and a lack of dynamic engagement in the original app. While Spotify is widely loved for its vast library and recommendations, its user interface (especially on mobile) can often feel overwhelming or uninspiring, especially for new users or casual listeners.

We reimagined the interface by introducing a cleaner, Apple-style layout — one that prioritizes space, minimalism, and smooth transitions. This gives users a more breathable experience, allowing key features like playlists, album art, and controls to stand out clearly without distractions.

To make the app feel more dynamic and emotionally connected to the user, we introduced particle animations in the background, simulating the idea that music is in constant motion. These subtle visuals give the app a sense of liveliness without affecting performance or clarity.

We also implemented a custom ripple cursor and hover effects, which significantly improves user interaction. This not only adds a fun, tactile feel but also helps the user understand exactly where they're clicking or tapping. These small changes make navigation more engaging and intuitive.

One of the key UX enhancements was in the button design and hover transitions. In the original version, buttons and links lacked feedback, often leading to hesitation or confusion. We addressed this by using vibrant hover effects that transition smoothly between colors (like black to orange), giving users a clear sense of interactivity and responsiveness.

In addition, we modernized the overall color scheme, opting for warmer tones and dynamic gradients that evoke emotion and match the mood of music. Typography was updated for better readability and visual harmony across the app. Icons were also refined — now larger, bolder, and more accessible — especially helpful for mobile users who rely on quick visual recognition.

All of these improvements work together to create a more intuitive, interactive, and emotionally engaging experience, while staying true to Spotify’s core identity. The redesign doesn’t change how users use the app — it just makes the entire experience smoother, friendlier, and more enjoyable.
